# 7.0 Introduction

The history of Zcash is intimately linked with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), particularly Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK). These mechanisms allow proving possession of certain information without revealing that information itself.

The Zcash initiative combines advanced mathematics with state-of-the-art encryption, smoothly incorporated into its software architecture. Navigating through the depths of knowledge required to comprehend Zcash can be scary. However, our approach will be to unveil these concepts as we journey through them, culminating in a profound understanding of how Zcash achieves its primary objective: preserving financial privacy on an open and secure blockchain.

Throughout this journey, we will delve into the annals of history, tracing Zcash's inception, and discerning the rationale behind pivotal decisions. By the end, you will possess a robust comprehension of the myriad components that constitute Zcash today, empowering you to delve deeper into any aspect presented herein.

While a foundation in undergraduate mathematics, programming, and blockchain understanding will certainly aid your exploration, it is not a prerequisite.

> [!NOTE]
> Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic protocols that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement. Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) is a specific type of ZKP that enables efficient verification of computations without disclosing the inputs and outputs involved.

> Privacy is paramount in financial transactions, safeguarding sensitive information from prying eyes and potential misuse. While traditional transparent blockchains like Bitcoin offer pseudonymous transactions, Zcash strives to elevate privacy to an unprecedented level, ensuring financial confidentiality for its users.
